So this time we thought of a different kind of App to work on , it picks random profile pictures of FACN4 mates & it allows you to rate which picture you mostly like & so on.. so at last the most rated picture WINS !
Feeling like you wanna change your profile picture ? Oh don't worry you're not the only one feeling this way ðŸ˜‚
Just keep it simple & genuine ðŸ˜Ž
It's so much FUN ðŸ˜œ

* **So What's Different? What's New** ?

  * **Using a database set locally & on Heruku for storing our Data instead of only keeping it in a Json file.**
 
  * **Using Architecture - Schemas** >> Link to [project diagrams (Schema, Wireframe, Architecture)](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/d92c2a07-f5b9-4232-beca-98c1db56c5e9)
 
  * **Migration rather than Integration .**
 
  * **Keeping the app secured as never attempted before.**

So this time we thought of a different kind of App to work on , it picks random profile pictures of FACsters & it allows you to rate which picture you like most & so on.. so at last the most rated picture WINS !
Feeling like you wanna change your profile picture ? Oh don't worry you're not the only one feeling this way ðŸ˜‚
Just keep it simple & genuine ðŸ˜Ž
It's so much FUN ðŸ˜œ

  * **Keeping the app secured as never attempted before.**
